I hope you enjoy this application!

Note: I used an HTTParty request to retrieve the movie data from The Movie DB. HTTParty made it really easy to send a request to The Movie DB's API and retrieve a JSON result.

Also, I used RSpec as my test suite.

Thanks for taking the time to check out my application!
